Assignment 1 (Intro to Info Tech)

My name is William Abeyanayake (s3707728).
Email: s3707728@student.rmit.edu.au

## About Me!

I am a Melbourne born, Sri Lankan student who is currently studying at RMIT City Campus.

I am from a Buddhist background and regularly participate in related events. (Poya, Kathina, Vesak etc) I have a limited understanding of Sinhala the most commonly spoken language in Sri Lanka.

I studied at Mazenod College (2010-2013) then transferred to John Monash Science School (2013-2015). After high school, I moved to Brisbane to study Pharmacy at Queensland University of Technology (QUT, 2016-2017).  Which leads to now, as I am studying Information Technology at RMIT, a complete change of field.

My favourite sport is Cricket and I watch every match vividly no matter who is playing. I spend a few hours each week at the nets, practicing bowling/batting techniques with a bat I refurbished (insert picture). 

I enjoy listening to music and following music production, in particular the work of Kanye West. This is alongside my interest in song writing in which Kanye and xxxtentacion, amongst others, are my main inspirations. 

In my down time I enjoy spending time with my partner, driving to forests/gardens and walking trails, absorbing the energy provided by nature and surrounding animal life. And of course, streaming movies or going to the cinema, and cruising around in Forza Horizon to ease my existence. 

## Interest in IT 

My interest in IT comes from my dad. Since I was small, I was surrounded by hardware and set up multiple computers. As I got older, I started using more and more software and getting familiar with different operating systems and started configuring bios’. As I grew up, my interest in IT grew as well although initially choosing a different field, I was constantly thinking of ideas to implement technology in a health care setting. My dad really sparked this interest from the beginning.

I chose to study at RMIT because of the services and convivence the campus provides. It is a leading university and that is backed by engaging lecturers and content. I have received a lot of support since commencing my studies with RMIT and the university showed a keen interest to get me on board, so I gladly agreed.

I have an expectation to learn the most current standards in Information Technology and gain skills in expanding fields. I want to ready myself for the market that exists in 3- or 4-years’ time so I can easily apply my knowledge in a job or placement. I wish to better my communication and leadership skills through group work/projects and be a more approachable individual so I can be confident in any job that I have the opportunity to take on.

## Ideal Job

*Ethical Hacker*

[Job Advertisement](https://jobsinjapan.com/jobs/it-engineer-robot-%e6%b3%a8%e7%9b%aeai%e4%bc%81%e6%a5%ad-featured-ai-company/)

The position is an Information Technology Engineer in Artificial Intelligence. The job engages the development of a robot control system through non-programming and automation. The position is particularly appealing to me as I can expand on the progress of Artificial Intelligence and integrate robotics on a commercial level.

To be fit for the job it requires developmental experience in C++ specifically about robot control. Some skills noted as ‘welcome experience’ include good communication skills, strong knowledge of algorithms and data structures, experience in start-up projects/companies.

I currently possess knowledge in computer systems (Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Android, Linux/UNIX) and hardware (basic components and i/o), using a range of software suites (such as Office 365, Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft PowerApps, Adobe Creative Suite, Catalyst Production Suite) and management tools (VMWare, Remote Desktop services). 

I also have knowledge in cloud services like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, iCloud, Mi Cloud, and other products.

I know how to set up a desktop personal computer from parts and have it up and running within a reasonable timeframe.  I have experience in call centre customer support for the ATO and other organizations, using their data storage systems (still using some mainframe) and products. 

I also am contracted to buy and sell domain names and have a good knowledge of Google SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and the web domain market. 

To qualify for the position I have outlined above, I will have to undergo training in C++ (although this may change in given years). I will have to have a sound knowledge in artificial intelligence and will structure my degree to align with this. This will include me undertaking further study in this field, such as RMIT’s future skills program offering courses in AI and it would be advantageous to study post-graduate AI although this may not be required initially (overqualified).

I will have to build on my communication skills and have at least a working vocabulary in Japanese, due to the position’s location.
