Assignment 1 (Intro to Info Tech)

My name is William Abeyanayake (s3707728).
Email: s3707728@student.rmit.edu.au

## About Me!

I am a Melbourne born, Sri Lankan student who is currently studying at RMIT City Campus.

I am from a Buddhist background and regularly participate in related events. (Poya, Kathina, Vesak etc) I have a limited understanding of Sinhala the most commonly spoken language in Sri Lanka.

I studied at Mazenod College (2010-2013) then transferred to John Monash Science School (2013-2015). After high school, I moved to Brisbane to study Pharmacy at Queensland University of Technology (QUT, 2016-2017).  Which leads to now, as I am studying Information Technology at RMIT, a complete change of field.

My favourite sport is Cricket and I watch every match vividly no matter who is playing. I spend a few hours each week at the nets, practicing bowling/batting techniques with a bat I refurbished (insert picture). 

I enjoy listening to music and following music production, in particular the work of Kanye West. This is alongside my interest in song writing in which Kanye and xxxtentacion, amongst others, are my main inspirations. 

In my down time I enjoy spending time with my partner, driving to forests/gardens and walking trails, absorbing the energy provided by nature and surrounding animal life. And of course, streaming movies or going to the cinema, and cruising around in Forza Horizon to ease my existence. 

## Interest in IT 

My interest in IT comes from my dad. Since I was small, I was surrounded by hardware and set up multiple computers. As I got older, I started using more and more software and getting familiar with different operating systems and started configuring bios’. As I grew up, my interest in IT grew as well although initially choosing a different field, I was constantly thinking of ideas to implement technology in a health care setting. My dad really sparked this interest from the beginning.

I chose to study at RMIT because of the services and convivence the campus provides. It is a leading university and that is backed by engaging lecturers and content. I have received a lot of support since commencing my studies with RMIT and the university showed a keen interest to get me on board, so I gladly agreed.

I have an expectation to learn the most current standards in Information Technology and gain skills in expanding fields. I want to ready myself for the market that exists in 3- or 4-years’ time so I can easily apply my knowledge in a job or placement. I wish to better my communication and leadership skills through group work/projects and be a more approachable individual so I can be confident in any job that I have the opportunity to take on.

## Ideal Job

*Ethical Hacker*

[Job Advertisement](https://jobsinjapan.com/jobs/it-engineer-robot-%e6%b3%a8%e7%9b%aeai%e4%bc%81%e6%a5%ad-featured-ai-company/)

![alt text](https://github.com/thisismyactualname/wdabeyprofile/blob/master/job.PNG)

The position is an Information Technology Engineer in Artificial Intelligence. The job engages the development of a robot control system through non-programming and automation. The position is particularly appealing to me as I can expand on the progress of Artificial Intelligence and integrate robotics on a commercial level.

To be fit for the job it requires developmental experience in C++ specifically about robot control. Some skills noted as ‘welcome experience’ include good communication skills, strong knowledge of algorithms and data structures, experience in start-up projects/companies.

I currently possess knowledge in computer systems (Windows, Mac OS, iOS, Android, Linux/UNIX) and hardware (basic components and i/o), using a range of software suites (such as Office 365, Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft PowerApps, Adobe Creative Suite, Catalyst Production Suite) and management tools (VMWare, Remote Desktop services). 

I also have knowledge in cloud services like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, iCloud, Mi Cloud, and other products.

I know how to set up a desktop personal computer from parts and have it up and running within a reasonable timeframe.  I have experience in call centre customer support for the ATO and other organizations, using their data storage systems (still using some mainframe) and products. 

I also am contracted to buy and sell domain names and have a good knowledge of Google SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and the web domain market. 

To qualify for the position I have outlined above, I will have to undergo training in C++ (although this may change in given years). I will have to have a sound knowledge in artificial intelligence and will structure my degree to align with this. This will include me undertaking further study in this field, such as RMIT’s future skills program offering courses in AI and it would be advantageous to study post-graduate AI although this may not be required initially (overqualified).

I will have to build on my communication skills and have at least a working vocabulary in Japanese, due to the position’s location.

## Personality

I have completed the following tests to understand my personality and learning style,

**[Myers-Briggs test](https://www.onlinepersonalitytests.org/mbti/)**

Results:

![alt text](https://github.com/thisismyactualname/wdabeyprofile/blob/master/tactile.PNG)

These results gave me a detailed view of my learning style, personality traits and how I interact with people around me. The results have been accurate in their assessment of me and they have quite meaningful insights into my own personal characteristics. It also highlights aspects of myself that I can improve on such as ‘extraversion’ which will boost my social experiences. 

Being in a social situation, as the results suggest, my energy gets drained and it takes an effort to engage and be present. This will particularly impact me when working in a team, and I will need to be more communicative will my group members. Being big picture thinking rather than detailed oriented may create conflict with opposing personalities and I will have to have a more focused effort on smaller details. 

When forming a team, it would be ideal to have a person who prioritizes organization (as I delay decision making in-case the situation changes) and a person who is detailed oriented. It also may be helpful having a more extroverted person in the team to create more opportunities for discussion. Having a person with a similar personality would also be good to bounce ideas off and enhance collaboration. 

## Project

*Emotion Detecting Security Cameras (Malicious Intent)*

### What is this project about?
This project uses machine learning to detect emotion from the subject, using facial recognition in security cameras. The idea is to increase security in public venues or areas and have real-time threat detection in and around the premises. The project itself is integrating facial detection API’s into security cameras that are optimized to target and focus on the patron’s face. 

Ultimately it analyses the subject’s face and assigns them an emotional state. By analysing the data, we can determine potential risks and can filter them out for secondary screening before entering the venue. As the project detects more faces, through machine learning, its accuracy and consistency will improve.

### Why is it needed?

We live in a day and age in which public attacks, of any nature, have become almost expected. In just 2019 and in the United States alone, there has been a counting total of 135 victims from mass shootings, all occurring in public venues. It is a sad reality we all must face but not one we should ignore. 

Increasing the security of our venues and in turn the protection of our community is vital more than ever. This is where my project fits in, it aims to eliminate potential attacks, keep a safe environment and hopefully stop that total continuing to count.

This project can be used widespread to create safer environments for people to enjoy.

### How it works

The product once installed tracks eye movements, facial position, lip and nose size/movement fluctuations, and facial expression. It takes the data it tracks and assigns it to an emotional state based of a criterion. Each emotion fits a certain pattern presented by the patron and the camera records and analysis these patterns in real-time. 

This information is stored in a database and checks are completed. Once an appropriate match is detected an emotion is assigned. Based on the assigned emotion and movement characteristics (acting erratically, running/pacing around, throwing arms around etc) of the individual, a threat level is determined. Dependant on the severity of the threat level certain action is required to be undertaken (immediate arrest/inform police), alerts will be sent out across all platforms with time elapsed since detection.

This is shown visually on the camera feed, which is displayed on panels in a private security monitoring room and on security members personal device.

Security members access the feed through their mobile phone or iPad etc and open the associated application for the project. The application is for internal use only and protected by 2-factor authentication. As mentioned above they are alerted about potential threats via system notifications, providing them with a snapshot of the individual, threat level, timestamp and location (and time elapsed).

One of the drawbacks of the project is its accuracy but this is combated by machine learning, in an attempt to improve this over its continued use. Another issue is if the individual is covering their face (e.g. a low wearing hat or mask etc) as this will impede the facial recognition technology. 

The camera itself is the host to a range of capabilities including endless pan (360 degrees rotation) as well as being able to tilt vertically and horizontally so it can view all angles. The camera sends recorded data through wired connections to the database, although its feed can be accessed wirelessly through secure login. It does this locally and externally through sharing IP.  

Another feature of the camera is its ability to work under low light conditions due to its digitally optimized large image sensor making it ideal for the API’s to work consistently.

Alongside this the camera possess the ability to work under dark night conditions with infrared sight. It can do this with colour video though this technology is not yet that reliable and we will assume its functionally is limited for this project. This provides a layer of security when the venue is closed, with a predetermined distance anyone can be near the venue. If this is violated an alert is sent to the afterhours security team for them to follow up on. 

Even though all this is set up, human error is still a major drawback as if security don’t respond to the products output then the threat still remains. The systems has to be implemented as a core security method and used frequently in addition to physical surveillance.

### What resources are required?

> Some tools and technologies will be required to set up the project.

*Physical equipment such as* 

- High resolution surveillance camera (4K+ recording/capture, large image sensor, advanced digital/optical zoom, infrared vision) – The camera also needs to be able to detect, recognize and identify at distance with endless pan and a tilt function. Wireless functionality/IP access.

![alt text](https://github.com/thisismyactualname/wdabeyprofile/blob/master/cam.jpg)

- Display panels in a private monitoring room providing real time camera feeds and complete analysis.

- A database server or servers with expansive storage and RAID backup. Alternatively, Data can be hosted in secure cloud storage

> Software required such as

- Facial Detection API’s like Emotient or Affectiva to overlay/intergrate into the camera feed to detect in real time the user’s expressed emotion, categorising the data in each variable (anger, frustration, sad, happy etc) into threat levels. 

- Client application for security members around venue (accessible via personal device i.e. mobile phone, iPad etc)
Application requires updated android and iOS support and polls data from the database or cloud storage. Notifies security member of threats detected via pop up/shade notifications. Provides a low-quality stream of camera feeds.

### What skills are required to complete this project

*To complete the project some skills are needed,*

1. Fluent knowledge in C++/Java is required to write the code associated with the API’s chosen to add to the cameras. Also, to get the system (camera and code) to learning through its own experience and improve on its performance. (Machine learning is also publicly updated through the API)

2. Competent in installing and operating surveillance cameras and connecting them to servers.

3. Setting up database servers and display panels for monitoring.

4. Use of android/apple SDK’s and environments to create an associated mobile application in Java or Kotlin.

***It is very feasible to get obtain the skills required over time and set up the project.***

### Project Outcomes

A successful completion of the project will result in improved security across the venue it is set up in. Intruders or potential threats to people inside the venue will be targeted by officials prior to entering the premises and be dealt with before any damage is done. In turn creating a reduction in attacks to the venue itself and people who frequent it. 

A successful rollout will impact the security camera market (adding facial recognition functionality as a standard consumer feature) and will gain the interest of more venues hoping to increase their security. Widespread use of this project will provide added safety to schools, concerts, public venues and events. Positively impacting the wellbeing of all, allowing them to roam a little more securely.
