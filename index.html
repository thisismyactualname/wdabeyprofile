# About Me!

I am a Melbourne born, Sri Lankan student who is currently studying at RMIT City Campus.

I am from a Buddhist background and regularly participate in related events. (Poya, Kathina, Vesak etc) I have a limited understanding of Sinhala the most commonly spoken language in Sri Lanka.

I studied at Mazenod College (2010-2013) then transferred to John Monash Science School (2013-2015). After high school, I moved to Brisbane to study Pharmacy at Queensland University of Technology (QUT, 2016-2017).  Which leads to now, as I am studying Information Technology at RMIT, a complete change of field.

My favourite sport is Cricket and I watch every match vividly no matter who is playing. I spend a few hours each week at the nets, practicing bowling/batting techniques with a bat I refurbished (insert picture). 

I enjoy listening to music and following music production, in particular the work of Kanye West. This is alongside my interest in song writing in which Kanye and xxxtentacion, amongst others, are my main inspirations. 

In my down time I enjoy spending time with my partner, driving to forests/gardens and walking trails, absorbing the energy provided by nature and surrounding animal life. And of course, streaming movies or going to the cinema, and cruising around in Forza Horizon to ease my existence.
